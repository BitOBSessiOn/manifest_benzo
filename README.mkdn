Benzo Rom
===========

This is just my manifest for shamu that I use to build my ROM.


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Benzo, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/BenzoRom/manifest_benzo.git -b lollipop

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
